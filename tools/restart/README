RESTART-REDISTRIBUTE TOOL

The restart-redistribute tool is a tool allows a SAMRAI user to take
restart files that came from a run on a certain number of processors and
create a new set of restart files which can be used to launch a restarted
run on a different number of processors.

SAMRAI's restart mechanism works by having each processor write a single
restart file for each restart dump.  The ordinary usage of these restart files
requires that a restarted run be launched on exactly the same number of
processors as was used on the run that created the restart files.  The
restart-redistribute tool is only to be used when a restarted run on a
different number of processors is desired.

In order to build the restart-redistribute tool, the SAMRAI library must first
be compiled (see INSTALL file in top-level SAMRAI directory).  After
compilation of the library, go to the subdirectory tools/restart in the
object directory where SAMRAI was compiled and build the tool by typing
'make'.  The executable program restart-redistribute will be created.

To use the tool, one must first have a set of restart files that was dumped
from a run of a SAMRAI-based application.  The restart files will be in a
directory tree that looks something like:

restart-dir/restore.00005/nodes.00008/proc.00000
                                     /proc.00001
                                     /proc.00002
                                     /proc.00003
                                     /proc.00004
                                     /proc.00005
                                     /proc.00006
                                     /proc.00007

'restart-dir' is the directory containing all of the restart dumps.  The
name of this directory is specified in the input file for the application.
'restart-dir' contains a set of subdirectories with names in the format
of 'restore.*****',where the *'s are replaced by a 5-digit integer.  The
integer identifies which restart dump is contained within the subdirectory.
So in the above example, restart.00005 contains the 5th restart dump from
the application.  The 'restore.*****' subdirectory contains a subdirectory
'nodes.*****', with the *'s replaced by a 5-digit integer that indicates
the number of processors on which the application ran.  The 'nodes.*****'
subdirectory then contains the set of HDF files containing the restart data.
The HDF files are named with the format 'proc.*****', with the *'s replaced
by a 5-digit integer that indicates the MPI rank of the the processor which
wrote its data to each particular file.

The usage of the restart redistribute tool is:

restart-redistribute INPUT-DIR OUTPUT-DIR RESTORE-NUMBER NUM-OUTPUT-FILES

INPUT-DIR - the directory containing the restart dumps from a run
OUTPUT-DIR - the name of the directory to contain new restart files
RESTORE-NUMBER - integer identifier of the particular restart dump to be
                 processed by the tool
NUM-OUTPUT-FILES - the number of output HDF files to be produced by the tool;
                   this is the number of processors desired for a new restarted
                   run of the application.

To run the tool on the example given above to create new restart files for a
run on 16 processors, one would use:

restart-redistribute restart-dir new-restart-dir 5 16

The result would be 16 HDF restart files in the subdirectory
new-restart-dir/restore.00005/nodes.00016, which could then be used for
a new restarted run.
