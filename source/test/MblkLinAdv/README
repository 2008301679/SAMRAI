## Description:   MULTIBLOCK LINEAR ADVECTION EQUATION EXAMPLE
##
#########################################################################

This example is similar to the single-block AMR LinAdv sample application.
This example has the following differences:

   1. It works on non-cartesian mapped grids 
   2. It works with multiblock grids
   3. All numerical kernel operations (e.g. computeFluxesOnPatch()) are
      c-based rather than fortran

The three test cases included are:

   1. wedge_1blk.3d  - single block mapped wedge grid 
   2. octant_3blk.3d - multi block (3 blocks) mapped octant grid 

Note that the numerics for this example have not been fully tested in 2D so it
currently should only run in 3D.
 
COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
-------------------------
   Compilation:
      make main

   Execution:
      For one of the following input files:
         test_inputs/octant_3blk.3d.input
         test_inputs/wedge_1blk.3d.input
      serial:
         ./main <input file>
      parallel:
         Parallel execution is platform dependent.  This example demonstrates
         execution via mpirun.
         mpirun -np <nprocs> [options] ./main <input file>
