## Description:   Multiblock Euler Example
##
#########################################################################

This example is similar to the single-block Euler sample application.
This example has the following differences:

   1. It works on non-cartesian mapped grids 
   2. It works with multiblock grids
   3. All numerical kernel operations (e.g. computeFluxesOnPatch()) are
      c-based rather than fortran

The included test case is:

   1. octant_3blk - multi block (3 blocks) mapped octant grid 

Note that the numerics for this example have not been fully tested in 2D so it
currently should only run in 3D.
 
COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
-------------------------

   Compilation:
      make main

   Execution:
      serial:
         ./main test_inputs/octant_3blk.3d.input
      parallel:
         Parallel execution is platform dependent.  This example demonstrates
         execution via mpirun.
         mpirun -np <nprocs> [mpirun options] ./main test_inputs/octant_3blk.3d.input
