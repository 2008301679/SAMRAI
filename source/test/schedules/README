This directory contains files to execute a test of the different 
algorithms used for schedule construction in SAMRAI.  The tests
use the accuracy verification done in the "Euler" test problem 
(located in source/test/applications/Euler) to verify that all
the different schedule construction options will generate 
identical results.  

Running the test involves two steps:

   1. Generating the input files:
        sh gen-input-files.sh 

        -> creates set of test-2d-append-N.input
    
   2. Executing the code
        make main2d 
        main2d test-2d-append-1.input
        main2d test-2d-append-2.input
        ...

Alternatively, you can simply do "make check" (or "make check2d"
or "make check3d") which will do these steps automatically.

Step 1 above takes an input file from the Euler test case
(test-2d.input) and appends to it a file (e.g. append-1.input)
which contains the particular "GlobalInputs{}" input entries
to specify the schedule option.  For example, the contents
of the different "append-N.input" files are as follows:

append-1.input:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   GlobalInputs {
      refine_schedule_generation_method = "BOX_TREE"
   }
        
append-2.input:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   GlobalInputs {
      refine_schedule_generation_method = "BOX_GRAPH"
   }

append-3.input:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   GlobalInputs {
      refine_schedule_generation_method = "ORIG_NSQUARED"
   }

The resulting file - test-2d-append-[N].input - contains the modified test
option without having to maintain many input files.
