Description: README file for boundary tests.

This directory contains a Makefile to build tests
for the boundary utilities classes.  It is used in the autotest
suite of SAMRAI.

The Makefile operates on the example code in the examples
directory.  The programs are run in serial only since the
functionality is the same in parallel.

2D and 3D test input files are included in this directory:
   basic2d-*.input - contains input for 2d boundary tests
   basic3d-*.input - contains input for 3d boundary tests
