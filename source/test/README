#########################################################################

The SAMRAI/source/test directory contains test codes that
verify correctness of various components in the library.  
All tests included here are run through our autotest suite
to assure accurate results.

The following summarizes the tests carried out in the 
different sub-directories:

applications:   
   Compile cases in the /source/applications directory
   with the local "AutoTester" class included.  The AutoTester
   class checks the state of various objects used in the 
   application at the end of the run and compares them to 
   the expected "correct" result entered in the input file.

   The Euler case carries out one additional test on the
   correctness of the Riemann problem.  Data files specify 
   the correct fluxes after a certain number of steps (to
   10 digits accuracy).  The solution can be verified by
   doing a "diff" on the output data file with these
   correct result files.

   Requires the testlib be built.

async_comm:

boundary:
   A set of tests to check the correctness of the routines to set various 
   physical boundary conditions supplied by the CartesianBoundaryUtilities
   classes in the Application Utilities package.

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/examples/boundary directory.

clustering:
   Requires the testlib be built.

communication:
   Performs a set of tests that invoke data transfer operations
   between patches using cell, face, node, and side datatypes.
   In addition to communication, this test verifies the accuracy
   of the interpolation (i.e. coarsen and refine) operations 
   carried out on these various datatypes.  The grid hierarchy 
   configuration and number of processors may be set through the 
   input file.  

   Requires the testlib be built.

dataaccess:

dataops:
   Tests various data operations with cell, face, node, side,
   and edge datatypes across the hierarchy and for complex
   operations.  The operations set data on patches and 
   test operations like linear_sum(), dot_product(), 
   axmy(), etc. on the hierarchy.  The grid hierarchy is
   fixed.

dimension:

dlbg:
   Requires the testlib be built.

FAC_adaptive:

FAC_nonadaptive:

fill_pattern:

hierarchy:
   A set of tests to check the correctness of the PatchHierarchy operations
   to make coarsened and refined versions of a given AMR patch hierarchy.

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/source/test/hierarchy
   directory.

hypre:

ieee:

indexdata:

inputdb:
   A set of tests to check the correctness of the routines to read data
   from SAMRAI inut files defined in the tbox:InputDatabase class.

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/source/test/inputdb
   directory.

LoadBalanceCorrectness:
   Requires the testlib be built.

logger:

MappedBoxLevelConnectorUtilsTests:

mapped_box_set_iterators:

MappingConnector:

mblkcomm:

MblkEuler:
   Requires the testlib be built.

MblkLinAdv:
   Requires the testlib be built.

mblktree:

nonlinear:

patchbdrysum:
   A set of tests to check operations for summing node and edge data across
   shared points on the boundaries of patches in a SAMRAI patch hierarchy. 

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/examples/patchbdrysum
   directory.

performance:
   Requires the testlib be built.

pointer:
   A set of tests to basic operation of SAMRAI smart pointers.

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/source/test/pointer
   directory.

rank_group:

restartdb:

samrai_mpi:

sparsedata:

sundials:

testlib:
   Not a test itself but a collection of classes and methods common to multiple
   tests.  There are no associated tests.

testtools:

timers:
   Tests use of timers, verifying nested structure, input,
   parallel usage, and restart capability.

transformation:

variables:
   A set of tests to check operations provided by the SAMRAI VariableDatabase
   class.

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/source/test/variables
   directory.

vector:
   Tests the SAMRAI vector classes. In particular, the SAMRAI-PETSc
   and SAMRAI-Kinsol vector interfaces.  Tests use a specific
   grid hierarchy layout and can only be tested on 1 or 2 processors.
