  @page package_algorithm_hyperbolic Hyperbolic Conservation Law Integration

  These classes provide algorithmic components that apply to a system of 
  hyperbolic conservation laws that is integrated using explicit 
  time-stepping.  In particular, these classes provide specific operations 
  invoked from within the time-dependent hierarchy integration and 
  adaptive gridding classes which are also part of the Algorithm package.
  The hyperbolic integrator class is coupled to the hierarchy time 
  integration and adaptive gridding routines via the Strategy design pattern.  
  An abstract base class that defines the interface to application-specific 
  numerical routines for single patches is also provided here.  The 
  hyperbolic integrator and the application routines are also coupled 
  using the Strategy pattern.
