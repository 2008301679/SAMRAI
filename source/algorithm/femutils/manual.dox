  @page package_algorithm_femutils Rudimentary Support for Finite Element Operations on SAMR Meshes
 
  The Algorithm package contains some basic functionality for summing node and edge data quantities 
  at shared points between neighboring patches.  Such operations are commonly found in finite element
  computations.  For example, when applying finite element integration that take contributions from 
  each element to a node or edge, one can divide the problem into patches, do operations on each
  patch, and then accumulate the neighboring patch contributions by employing a patch boundary node 
  or edge sum. These classes are partitioned into two categories:

  -# @ref package_algorithm_femutils_standard "operations applicable when all simulation data live on all patches on the patch levels involved"
  -# @ref package_algorithm_femutils_locallyactive "operations applicable when simulation data live on subsets of patches on the patch levels involved, so-called 'locally-active' data"
