  @page package_mesh_gridding Patch Hierarchy Construction and Adaptive Meshing 

  The gridding algorithm classes provid patch hierarchy generation and 
  regridding routines that apply to a variety of structured adaptive 
  mesh refinement problems.  Specifically, the gridding class can be used
  to generate individual levels in an AMR patch hierarchy at the beginning 
  of a simulation and to regrid collections of levels during an adaptive 
  calculation.  Other classes are provided to apply different methods for
  selecting cells for refinement on the patch hierarchy.   These include
  basic gradient detection and Richardson extrapolation.

  The gridding class is coupled to application-specific routines that 
  initialize data on new levels and identify cells for refinement on each 
  level via the Strategy object-oriented design pattern.  The gridding 
  class is coupled to particular load balancing and cell clustering routines 
  using this pattern as well.
