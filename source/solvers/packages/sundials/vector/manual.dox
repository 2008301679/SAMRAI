  @page package_solvers_packages_sundials_vector Sundials Vector Interface

  The abstract Sundials vector class provides an interface through which a 
  vector kernel and operations may be supplied to the KINSOL nonlinear 
  algebraic equation and CVODE ODE system solver packages.  Apart from 
  some minor preprocessor stuff, this interface is completeley 
  independent of the SAMRAI package.  A vector kernel derived from 
  this interface that may be used with the SAMRAI framework is provided 
  elsewhere in this SAMRAI "solvers" package.

  Note: These vector interface routines assume <TT>double</TT>-valued vectors.
