  @page package_solvers_packages_petsc PETSc Vector Interface

  An abstract PETSc vector interface is provided to couple a vector 
  kernel and operations with the PETSc solver library.
  The templated interface class supports double or float.
  Since PETSc
  also supports vectors with complex entries, a complex vector interface
  class may be provided in the future if such a need arises.  A vector 
  kernel derived from this interface that may be used with the SAMRAI
  framework is provided in the SAMRAI Algorithm package.  However, the 
  interface provided here is entirely independent of SAMRAI.  
  The vector interface conforms to PETSc version 2.1.6.  In the future, it
  will be maintained to be current with the latest PETSc version.

  The interfaces to the PETSC nonlinear solver SNES is provided through
  the wrapper class SAMRAI::solv::SNES::SAMRAIContextX.  This class allows
  you to use SNES with the natively supported
  SAMRAI::solv::PETScAbstractVectorReal class.  The nonlinear solver
  requires certain user-provided operations that must be provided
  through inheriting the interface class SAMRAI::solv::SNESAbstractFunctions.

  PETSc was developed in the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at 
  Argonne National Laboratory (ANL).  For more information about PETSc, 
  see http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/.
